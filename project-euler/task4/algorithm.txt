Initialize Variables:

Set i to 2, the smallest prime number.
Factorization Loop:

While i is less than or equal to number:
Check if number is divisible by i.
If true:
Divide number by i.
This step ensures that we are dividing out the smallest prime factor.
If not divisible, increment i by 1.
Return Result:

The final value of i is the largest prime factor of the original number.
