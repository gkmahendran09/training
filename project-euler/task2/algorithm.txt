Initialize Variables:

Set fib1 to 1 (the first Fibonacci number).
Set fib2 to 2 (the second Fibonacci number).
Set sum to 0 to store the sum of even Fibonacci numbers.
Fibonacci Loop:

Start a while loop that continues as long as fib2 is less than or equal to the specified limit.
Inside the loop:
Check if fib2 is an even number using the condition if (fib2 % 2 === 0).
If true, add fib2 to the sum.
Calculate the next Fibonacci number (nextFib) by adding fib1 and fib2.
Update fib1 to the current value of fib2, and fib2 to the calculated next Fibonacci number.
Result:

The loop exits when fib2 exceeds the specified limit. The final result is the sum of even Fibonacci numbers not exceeding the given limit.
Output:

Return the value of sum as the result.
